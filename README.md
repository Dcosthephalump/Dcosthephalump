### Hi, my name is David (Costello) 👋

I am a senior at ASU studying mathematics doing research in Greek manuscript transcription. The hope is to create a way of automatically transcribing handwritten Greek texts for analysis in the Digital Humanities.

I come from Grand Junction, CO, ⛰️🏜️ so I have a significant interest in pursuing research for agriculture, urban development, and water rights/use in the future as a way to give back to a community that has given me so much.

I started my college years pursuing a degree in biophysics, but I found the mathematics and the philosophy of science and logic more interesting.

My GitHub username comes from my oldest sibling and I have used it for over a decade now. Someday it will be more professional.

Outside of mathematics (in a loose order):
- 📝 I am applying for a PhD at ASU (looking at Computer Science, Applied Mathematics, Complex Adaptive Systems Science
- 🗺️ I am studying Greek and Hebrew to read manuscripts
- 🏋🏻‍♂️ I try to work out
- ✏️ I am writing (slowly) a manual on debate
- 🏅 I am part of the 1890 Society
